## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Day 1** | 5-7 min | Onboarding assessment + first quick win exercise |

## Session Length (Research-Backed)

- **Average mobile app session:** ~5 minutes
- **Noom's approach:** 5-10 minute daily lessons (gold standard)
- **Optimal first session:** 10-15 minutes (onboarding + quick win)
- **Daily target:** 5-10 minutes active content
- **Weekly deeper session:** One 15-20 minute exercise per week

**Design rule:** Every interaction completable in under 5 minutes. Longer exercises break into save-and-resume segments.

- **Spider/radar charts** showing growth across dimensions
- **Before/after assessment comparisons** (baseline retaken at 30/60/90 days)
- **Visual journey map** showing position in coaching path
