# Market Analysis: Coaching App

## Market Overview

- **Market Size (2025):** $3.5-4.1 billion

## Categories Ranked by Opportunity

| Rank | Category | Market Size | Why It's Good |
|------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Career & Work** | $15.4B industry | Highest demand; job transitions, leadership, burnout |
| 2 | **Relationships** | $2B → $5.77B by 2033 (12.5% CAGR) | Underserved; few dedicated coaching apps |
| 3 | **Health & Wellness** | $84.5B corporate wellness by 2027 | Fastest-growing; mental health, stress, sleep |
| 4 | **Financial** | $10.27B Gen Z/Millennial financial literacy | Strong pull from younger demographics |
| 5 | **Personal Growth** | $3.64B life coaching market | Broad appeal; overlaps with all other categories |

## Recommendation

Start with **2-3 categories** (Career + Relationships + Personal Growth), then expand. Life challenges are interconnected — a job loss affects finances, relationships, and mental health. A multi-domain approach is a genuine differentiator.
