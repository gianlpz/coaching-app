      "content": "Positive psychology research has identified 24 universal character strengths that all humans share in different combinations. Unlike skills you learn, character strengths are the natural capacities that energize you when you use them. You might be great at spreadsheets, but if it drains you, that's a skill \u2014 not a strength. True strengths meet three criteria: they feel authentic (\"this is the real me\"), they feel energizing (not depleting), and you learn quickly when you use them. Studies show that people who use their top strengths at work are six times more likely to be engaged and three times more likely to report an excellent quality of life.",
      "keyTakeaway": "A real strength isn't just something you're good at \u2014 it's something that feels natural, energizes you, and makes you feel like the most authentic version of yourself."
