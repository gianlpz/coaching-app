      "title": "The Gap That Drains You",
      "content": "Ever had a job that looked perfect on paper but still felt wrong? That nagging feeling usually comes from a values gap \u2014 a disconnect between what matters most to you and what your daily work actually looks like. The bigger the gap, the more drained you feel, even when everything else is going well."

      "title": "Values Alignment Is a Spectrum",
      "content": "In ACT, psychological flexibility means being able to act in line with your values even when things are hard. But before you can do that, you need to know where you stand. Think of each value like a dial \u2014 it's never fully on or fully off. You might deeply value creativity but only get to exercise it in tiny pockets of your week. That partial alignment is still something to build on. Research shows that even small increases in values alignment lead to measurable improvements in job satisfaction and resilience. You don't need a perfect match \u2014 you need to know where the gaps are so you can start closing them intentionally.",
      "keyTakeaway": "You don't need perfect alignment to feel fulfilled \u2014 knowing where the gaps are gives you the power to close them, one small step at a time."
