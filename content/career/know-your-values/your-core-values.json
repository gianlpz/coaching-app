      "content": "Values are the things that matter most to you \u2014 not what you think should matter, but what actually energizes you when it shows up in your work. Research from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy shows that when people align their actions with their values, they experience more meaning, less burnout, and greater resilience during tough times. Values aren't goals you check off. They're directions you move toward, like a compass heading. You can always take one more step toward creativity, or connection, or growth \u2014 there's no finish line. That's what makes them so powerful for career decisions.",
