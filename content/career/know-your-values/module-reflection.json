      "content": "In coaching, we say that awareness without action is just entertainment. The work you've done so far has built a real foundation \u2014 but the magic happens when you use that self-knowledge to guide real decisions. The GROW model from coaching science gives us a helpful frame: you've been working on the G (Goal \u2014 what matters to you) and the R (Reality \u2014 where you are now). The next step is exploring Options and building Will to act. Your values and strengths aren't just interesting facts about yourself. They're decision-making tools. Every time you face a career choice \u2014 big or small \u2014 you can ask: does this move me toward my values? Does it use my strengths?",
      "keyTakeaway": "Self-knowledge is only powerful when you use it as a compass for real decisions \u2014 your values and strengths are your personal decision-making toolkit."
