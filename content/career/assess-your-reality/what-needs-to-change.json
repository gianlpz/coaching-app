      "content": "If you've ever felt pulled in two directions about your career \u2014 part of you wanting to stay, part wanting to go \u2014 that's not weakness. That's your brain doing exactly what it's designed to do: weighing risk and reward. The problem is, most of us try to resolve this debate in our heads, where it just spins in circles. Let's get it on paper."

      "title": "Decisional Balance: Making the Invisible Visible",
      "content": "Motivational Interviewing uses a tool called a decisional balance to help people work through ambivalence \u2014 that stuck feeling when you want to change and want to stay at the same time. Here's the insight: ambivalence isn't a problem to overcome. It's information to work with. Every choice has benefits and costs on both sides. When you list them out honestly, something shifts. You stop spinning and start seeing. Some people discover their reasons to stay are stronger than they thought. Others realize their reasons to change have been quietly building for years. Both outcomes are valuable because either way, you move from confusion to clarity.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Ambivalence about career change isn't a problem to fix \u2014 it's information to explore, and putting it on paper transforms confusion into clarity."
