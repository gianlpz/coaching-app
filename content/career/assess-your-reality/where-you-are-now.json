      "title": "The Six Dimensions of Career Satisfaction",
      "content": "Career satisfaction isn't one thing \u2014 it's a combination of factors that each contribute to how you feel about your work. The GROW model starts by asking: what is your current Reality? Not where you wish you were, but where you honestly are today. Research on career wellbeing identifies six key dimensions: meaningful work, achievement, relationships, compensation, growth, and work-life balance. Most people who feel stuck or unhappy at work assume the whole thing is broken. But when you rate each dimension separately, you almost always find that some areas are doing better than others. That's incredibly useful information.",
