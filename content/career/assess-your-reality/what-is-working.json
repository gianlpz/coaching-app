Even in the worst job, there are bright spots worth examining."

      "content": "In Motivational Interviewing and solution-focused coaching, there's a powerful technique called exception-finding. Instead of asking \"What's wrong?\" you ask \"When was it right?\" Every career has exceptions \u2014 moments when you felt engaged, capable, and alive at work. These exceptions aren't random. They contain patterns that reveal the exact conditions you need to thrive. Maybe you come alive when you're teaching someone. Maybe your best work happens in the morning with music on. Maybe you light up when you're solving a problem nobody else can crack. These clues are gold because they show you what to look for in your next move.",
