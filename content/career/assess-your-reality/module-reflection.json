      "content": "Most people spend years feeling vaguely dissatisfied without ever stopping to actually examine what's going on. You just did that work in three lessons. You rated your satisfaction, found your bright spots, and faced the tug of war honestly. Now let's turn all of that into something you can actually use."

      "title": "From Assessment to Action",
      "content": "In the GROW coaching model, the R \u2014 Reality \u2014 is where most of the breakthroughs happen. That's because most people skip it. They jump from wanting something different (the Goal) straight to What should I do? (the Will). But when you truly understand your current reality, the right options often become obvious. Your reality isn't just about what's wrong. It includes what's working, what you've learned about yourself, and what you're genuinely ready for. A strong reality check combines honesty with self-compassion. You're not behind. You're not broken. You're a person gaining clarity \u2014 and clarity is the precondition for meaningful change.",
      "keyTakeaway": "A thorough, honest assessment of your current reality doesn't just identify problems \u2014 it reveals the exact leverage points where small changes create the biggest impact."
