      "title": "The Four Attachment Styles",
      "content": "In the 1960s, researchers discovered that how caregivers responded to us as children created lasting patterns in how we approach relationships. These patterns fall into four styles: Secure (comfortable with closeness and independence), Anxious (craves closeness but worries about being left), Avoidant (values independence and feels uncomfortable with too much closeness), and Disorganized (a mix of anxious and avoidant, often from unpredictable early experiences). Most people are a blend, not a rigid category. Your style can also shift depending on the relationship and how safe you feel.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Attachment styles are learned patterns, not personality flaws — and they can change with awareness and practice."
