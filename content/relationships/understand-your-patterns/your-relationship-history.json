      "title": "Why Your Past Matters",
      "content": "Our earliest relationships create templates for how we expect love and connection to work. Researchers call these \"internal working models\" — mental blueprints built from real experiences. They shape what feels safe, what triggers anxiety, and what makes us pull away. The good news is that these blueprints aren't permanent. Once you can see them clearly, you can start to redraw them. This isn't about blaming anyone — it's about understanding yourself with compassion.",
