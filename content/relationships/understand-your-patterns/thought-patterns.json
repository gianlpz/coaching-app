      "title": "Cognitive Distortions in Relationships",
      "content": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) teaches that our thoughts, feelings, and actions are all connected. When something happens in a relationship, we automatically interpret it — and that interpretation drives our emotional response. The problem is, our interpretations are often distorted by old patterns. Common distortions in relationships include mind-reading (assuming you know what they're thinking), catastrophizing (jumping to the worst-case scenario), personalization (believing everything is about you), and all-or-nothing thinking (they're either perfect or terrible). Recognizing these patterns doesn't mean your feelings are wrong — it means your automatic interpretation might deserve a second look.",
