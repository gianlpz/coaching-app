      "content": "You've done real work in this module — you've looked at your history, named your attachment style, and started catching your thought patterns. Now it's time to zoom out and see how all three connect. The picture that emerges might be the most useful thing you've learned about yourself in a long time."

      "title": "How It All Fits Together",
      "content": "Your relationship history shaped your attachment style. Your attachment style influences which cognitive distortions show up most. And those distortions drive the reactions that create repeating cycles in your relationships. For example, someone with an anxious attachment style might be more prone to mind-reading and catastrophizing — because their early experiences taught them that closeness is unreliable, so they're always scanning for danger. Someone with an avoidant style might lean toward minimizing or dismissing their own emotions, because they learned that needing people leads to disappointment. When you can see this chain clearly — history to style to thoughts to behavior — you gain something powerful: a choice point.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Your history shaped your attachment style, your style fuels specific thought distortions, and those distortions drive your relationship patterns — but seeing the chain gives you the power to interrupt it."
