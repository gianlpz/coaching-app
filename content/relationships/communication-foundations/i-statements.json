      "title": "Why 'You' Triggers Walls",
      "content": "Gottman's research found that conversations that start with criticism or blame (what he calls a \"harsh startup\") predict the outcome of the conversation with over 90% accuracy — and that outcome is almost always negative. When someone hears \"You always...\" or \"You never...\", their brain registers it as an attack and shifts into defense mode. The conversation stops being about solving a problem and starts being about winning or surviving. I-statements flip the script by expressing your experience without attacking the other person's character. The formula is simple: \"I feel [emotion] when [specific behavior] because [why it matters to me].\" This isn't about being soft or avoiding conflict. It's about being honest in a way the other person can actually hear.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Replacing 'you always/never' with 'I feel... when... because...' keeps conversations productive by expressing your needs without triggering the other person's defenses."
