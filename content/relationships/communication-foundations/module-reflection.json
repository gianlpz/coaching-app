Any one of them could improve a relationship overnight. But knowing a skill and using it are two different things. Let's make sure this doesn't stay as just knowledge."

      "title": "The Power of One Focus",
      "content": "Motivational Interviewing research shows that people who commit to one specific change are far more likely to follow through than those who try to change everything at once. This is because new behaviors need repetition to become habits, and spreading your attention across multiple skills means none of them get practiced enough to stick. The key is choosing the skill that would make the biggest difference in your life right now — not the one that sounds most impressive, but the one that connects to a real pain point or a real relationship you care about. When you focus on one skill, you start to notice opportunities to use it everywhere.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Committing to practice one communication skill consistently will create more real change than half-heartedly trying all three."
