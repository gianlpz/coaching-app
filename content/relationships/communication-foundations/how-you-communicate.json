      "title": "Four Communication Styles",
      "content": "Research on interpersonal communication identifies four core styles. Passive communicators avoid expressing their needs and often say \"it's fine\" when it isn't — they keep the peace but build resentment. Aggressive communicators express needs forcefully, often at the expense of others — they get heard but damage trust. Passive-aggressive communicators express frustration indirectly through sarcasm, the silent treatment, or subtle sabotage. Assertive communicators express their needs clearly and respectfully while considering the other person's perspective. Most of us use different styles in different situations — you might be assertive at work but passive with your family. The Gottman Method research shows that assertive communication is the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Assertive communication — expressing your needs clearly while respecting others — is the style most strongly linked to healthy, lasting relationships."
