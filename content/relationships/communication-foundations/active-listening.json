      "content": "Think about the last meaningful conversation you had. Were you fully present — or were you partly rehearsing what you'd say next, checking your phone, or waiting for your turn to talk? Most of us are better talkers than listeners, and our relationships pay the price."

      "title": "The Three Levels of Listening",
      "content": "Not all listening is created equal. Level 1 is Internal Listening — you hear the words, but you're focused on your own thoughts, reactions, and what you want to say next. This is where most people operate most of the time. Level 2 is Focused Listening — your full attention is on the other person. You're tracking their words, tone, and emotions. You're curious about their experience, not just waiting to respond. Level 3 is Global Listening — you pick up on everything: what's said, what's not said, body language, energy shifts, and the emotions underneath the words. This is the level that makes people feel truly seen. The Gottman Method calls this \"turning toward\" your partner — and it's one of the most powerful predictors of relationship success.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Moving from Level 1 (listening to respond) to Level 2 and 3 (listening to understand) is one of the simplest and most powerful relationship upgrades you can make."
