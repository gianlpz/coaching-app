      "content": "In Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, values are like a compass — they point you in a direction, but you never \"arrive\" at them the way you finish a goal. You can always move toward kindness, growth, or connection. Values aren't right or wrong. They're personal. Two people can live meaningful lives with completely different value sets. The key is knowing yours so you can make choices that feel like you.",
