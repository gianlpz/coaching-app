      "content": "Imagine you had a personal compass — one sentence that could guide your decisions when life gets noisy. Not a corporate mission statement, not an inspirational quote from someone else. Just a clear, honest line about what you're here to do. Today, you're going to write your first draft of that sentence."

      "title": "Purpose Is a Draft, Not a Decree",
      "content": "A lot of people freeze when they hear the word 'purpose' because it sounds permanent and grand. But your purpose statement is just a working draft — a snapshot of what matters to you right now. It will evolve as you do, and that's the point. A good purpose statement usually touches on two things: what you value most, and how you want to show up in the world. It doesn't need to be poetic. It needs to be honest. Think of it as a personal north star — close enough to guide you, far enough away to keep pulling you forward.",
