      "content": "Have you ever achieved a goal and felt... empty? You got the promotion, hit the number, finished the thing — and the happiness faded faster than you expected. That's because goals have finish lines, but the things that make life meaningful don't. Let's explore why."

      "title": "Goals End, Values Continue",
      "content": "A goal is something you can complete: run a marathon, get a degree, save $10,000. A value is a quality of action you can practice forever: being adventurous, showing up for your health, or growing as a person. Goals are useful — they give you structure and milestones. But when you attach your sense of meaning only to goals, you ride an emotional roller coaster of achieving and then feeling lost. The ACT approach is to let your values guide which goals you set, so that even the journey toward a goal feels meaningful.",
