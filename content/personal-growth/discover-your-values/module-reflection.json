      "title": "Why Reflection Matters",
      "content": "Research in psychology shows that reflection deepens learning more than additional practice alone. When you pause to notice what you've experienced, your brain encodes it differently — it moves from short-term awareness to lasting insight. In ACT, this is called 'contacting the present moment.' You're not analyzing yourself — you're just noticing what's here. This module asked you to explore your values, question your goals, and name your purpose. That's a lot. Giving yourself a few minutes to digest it is what turns an exercise into a real shift.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Reflection turns experiences into lasting insights by helping your brain process what you've learned."
