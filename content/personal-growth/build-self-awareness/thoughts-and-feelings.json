      "content": "Something happens. You feel a wave of frustration, anxiety, or sadness — and before you know it, you've snapped at someone, scrolled for an hour, or shut down entirely. It feels automatic. But there's actually a pattern running underneath, and once you see it, you can start to change it."

      "title": "The Thought-Feeling-Behavior Cycle",
      "content": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is built on a powerful idea: it's not events themselves that upset us, but the meaning we make of them. Here's how it works. Something happens (a situation). You have a thought about it — often so fast you barely notice. That thought triggers a feeling, and that feeling drives a behavior. For example: your friend cancels plans. You think 'they don't really care about me.' You feel hurt and lonely. You pull away and stop reaching out. The good news is that this cycle works in every direction. Change the thought, and the feeling shifts. Change the behavior, and new thoughts follow. The first step is simply noticing the cycle in action.",
