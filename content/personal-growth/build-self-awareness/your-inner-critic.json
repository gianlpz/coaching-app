      "content": "You know that voice. The one that says you're not good enough, smart enough, or far enough along. It chimes in after a mistake, before a risk, and sometimes just when you're trying to rest. Everyone has an inner critic. The problem isn't that it exists — it's that most of us think it's telling the truth."

      "title": "Defusing from Your Inner Critic",
      "content": "In ACT, the inner critic is understood as a pattern of thoughts your mind produces — not a reflection of reality. Your mind evolved to spot threats, and sometimes it treats your self-worth like a survival problem. The technique of 'cognitive defusion' means creating space between you and your thoughts. Instead of 'I'm a failure,' you notice: 'I'm having the thought that I'm a failure.' That tiny shift is enormous. It doesn't make the thought go away — it just means you don't have to believe it or obey it. One powerful defusion technique is to give your inner critic a name or character. When you externalize it, it loses some of its authority. It becomes a voice you can hear without being controlled by.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Your inner critic is a pattern of thoughts, not the truth — and naming it helps you stop being controlled by it."
