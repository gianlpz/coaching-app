      "title": "A Week of Paying Attention",
      "content": "This module asked you to do something deceptively simple: pay attention to yourself. You explored the thought-feeling-behavior cycle, met your inner critic, and practiced mindful check-ins. That might not sound dramatic, but self-awareness is the foundation every other skill is built on. Let's see what you've noticed."

      "title": "Awareness Is the First Domino",
      "content": "In both CBT and mindfulness traditions, self-awareness is considered the gateway skill. You can't change a pattern you don't see. You can't respond differently to a feeling you haven't named. This module gave you three tools: the thought record for catching cognitive patterns, defusion for creating distance from your inner critic, and body scans for tuning into physical and emotional signals. None of these require perfection. They only require practice. The more often you use them, the more automatic they become — until noticing your thoughts and feelings is just something you do, naturally.",
      "keyTakeaway": "Self-awareness is a skill that strengthens with practice, and it's the foundation for lasting personal change."
